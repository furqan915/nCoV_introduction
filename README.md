__figuremaker.R__ reproduces Figure 2 in the manuscript and demonstrates how to import and manipulate the NREVSS data.

__invasion_rates.R__ is used within figuremaker.R for the ode simulation

__invasion_ode_parallel.R__ is the code for the Latin Hypercube sampling procedure

__license.txt__ contains the GNU Version 3 license for use and redistribution of this code.

__nrevssCDC_ILI.csv__ contains the NREVSS data on the human betacoronaviruses, used in figuremaker.R

__postpandemicscenarios_full.nb__ is a _Mathematica_ file containing the simulation code for Figures 3-6 in the manuscript. It contains code for simulating the three-strain simulation model and the SARS-CoV-2 model with hospitalization and critical care arms.
